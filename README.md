TODO:
    - Clean DOM content using beautifulSoup
    - Parsing content to LLM, basically reducing it down to what the LLM can handle
    - Create prompt that LLM can consistently understand and return what I want. Must make sure that it returns data as dictionary of jobs
- Somehow I need to make sure that the previous dataset is updated accurately. I shouldn't change old records because if I link the entry to another database it might mess things up
- I need to push that data back out to notion, to the Job Postings Database
